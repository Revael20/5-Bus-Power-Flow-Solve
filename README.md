⚡ 5-Bus Power Flow Analysis: Gauss-Seidel vs. Newton Raphson Methods

📖 Project Description
This repository hosts a specialized Power Flow Analysis tool developed by Revael Pramudya Yudisthira (University of Sydney) to bridge the gap between theoretical electrical engineering and industry-standard simulation. The project centers on a 5-bus transmission network, modeled to simulate realistic grid conditions including generator reactive power constraints and line charging effects

🧪 The Core Challenge: PV-PQ Switching
In power systems, generators (PV buses) have physical limits on how much reactive power ($Q$) they can provide. If the grid demand exceeds these limits, the generator can no longer maintain its voltage setpoint55. This project implements Dynamic Logic that:
Detects $Q_{max}/Q_{min}$ limit violations during iterations.
Automatically converts the bus to a PQ-Limited type to maintain physical feasibility.
Recovers to PV mode if the system state returns within operating bounds8.

🛠 Technical Implementation
The solver compares two primary numerical methods:

1. Gauss-Seidel (GS) Solver:

Uses sequential updates based on nodal current equations.
Converged in 357 iterations for this 5-bus system.
Lower memory overhead but slower linear convergence.

2. Newton-Raphson (NR) Solver:
Uses a linearized Jacobian matrix ($J_1$ through $J_4$) and Taylor series expansion.
Incorporates the "Q-substitution trick" for efficient Jacobian diagonal derivation ($H_{ii}$ and $L_{ii}$)131313.
Converged in only 7 iterations, demonstrating superior quadratic convergence1414.

📊 Multi-Platform Verification
Every result generated by the MATLAB scripts was benchmarked against PowerWorld Simulator.

Bus 3 Limit Hit: Both MATLAB and PowerWorld confirm Bus 3 reaches its $Q_{max}$ of 1.5 pu.
Voltage Profile: Due to the limit, Bus 3 voltage drops to 0.9735 pu, a result verified across both platforms.
System Integrity: The Slack bus (Bus 1) provides 1.0271 pu of real power to balance system loads and line losses.
