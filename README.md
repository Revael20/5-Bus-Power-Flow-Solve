📖 Project Description

This repository hosts a specialized Power Flow Analysis tool developed to bridge the gap between theoretical electrical engineering and industry-standard simulation. The project centers on a 5-bus transmission network, modeled to simulate realistic grid conditions including generator reactive power constraints and line charging effects.

🧪 The Core Challenge

In power systems, generators (PV buses) have physical limits on how much reactive power (Q) they can provide.2 If the grid demand exceeds these limits, the generator can no longer maintain its voltage setpoint. This project implements a dynamic logic that detects these limit violations and automatically converts the bus to a PQ type—a feature typically found only in commercial-grade software.

🛠 Technical Implementation

The solver is built using the Gauss-Seidel numerical method. Key technical steps include:
Admittance Matrix ($Y_{bus}$): Full construction including series resistance, reactance, and shunt susceptance (charging capacitance) for accurate loss calculation.
Vectorized Computation: Optimized MATLAB loops to handle $N$ buses and $M$ generators.
Convergence Analysis: Iterative solving with a strict tolerance of $1 \times 10^{-9}$ to ensure high precision.
Multi-Platform Verification: Every result generated by the MATLAB script is benchmarked against PowerWorld Simulator to verify the model's accuracy in calculating nodal voltages and system-wide power flows.
